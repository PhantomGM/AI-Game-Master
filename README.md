# AI-Game-Master

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a desktop application that functions as a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) Game Master (GM) or assists a human GM. It will leverage AI agents to manage game rules, world-building, NPC interactions, and narrative design.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **AI Game Master:** Option to run games entirely managed by AI, including story generation, NPC actions, and rule enforcement.
*   **GM Assistance:** Tools and features to aid human GMs, such as:
    *   Rule lookups and conflict resolution.
    *   NPC management and dialogue generation.
    *   Encounter design and balancing.
    *   World-building support and lore management.
    *   Real-time session tracking and note-taking.
*   **Modular Agent System:** Utilizes a system of specialized AI agents for different aspects of the game, including:
    *   **Primary Agents:** Core game functions (Rules, World, NPCs, Narrative, Combat).
    *   **Support Agents:** Auxiliary tasks (Campaign Management, Session Flow, Player Engagement).
    *   **History Agents:** World history generation and integration.
*   **Customizable Game Systems:** Support for multiple TTRPG systems (e.g., D&D 5e initially, with potential for expansion).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A desktop application with an intuitive interface for both AI-driven and human-led games.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

*   **Agents:** Contains definitions and implementations for the different AI agents.
*   **Campaign:** Manages campaign-specific data, encounters, and sessions.
*   **DNA Coding:** (To be elaborated) - For defining NPC personality and behavior.
*   **Meta:** Project metadata, templates, and player information management.
*   **Rule Systems:** Data and logic for different TTRPG rule sets.
*   **World:** World-building elements (Bestiary, Characters, Culture, History, Items).
