The individuals who populate the world, shaping its stories and conflicts. Characters can be heroes, villains, rulers, common folk, or mythic beings, each playing a role in the unfolding narrative. They are divided into **Player Characters (PCs)**, controlled by players, and **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**, which include everyone else in the world, from powerful deities to humble merchants.
## [[Factions]]: Organizations, power groups, or collectives that influence the world in various ways. Factions can be political, religious, economic, military, or secretive, and they often serve as allies, enemies, or obstacles for both NPCs and Player Characters.

## [[NPCs]]: Non-Playe r Characters (NPCs) populate the world, serving as quest givers, allies, enemies, and background figures that shape the story and setting. They range from legendary figures to common townsfolk.
### [[Pantheons]]: A collection of deities, divine entities, or spiritual forces that shape religion, magic, and culture. Gods may be active in the world or distant figures worshiped through rituals, granting power to their followers.

### [[Major NPCs]]: Key figures who play a significant role in the world, such as rulers, faction leaders, or legendary heroes and villains. These characters drive major storylines and influence the game world in meaningful ways.

### [[Minor NPCs]]: Everyday citizens, traders, soldiers, and lesser-known individuals who fill the world with life. They may offer minor quests, provide local knowledge, or serve as background flavor in the setting.
 
## [[Player Characters]]: The protagonists of the story, controlled by players. Player Characters (PCs) explore the world, interact with NPCs and factions, and shape the narrative through their actions. They come from diverse backgrounds, wield unique abilities, and often rise to greatness—or infamy—through their adventures.
